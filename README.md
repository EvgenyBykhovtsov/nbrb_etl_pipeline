Sales Analysis: The first project is a simple analysis of 12 months of sales data. It answers common business questions using clear visualizations and graphs.

E-Store Database Project: The second project uses a dataset from an electronics store. It involves cleaning the data, uploading it to a local database, and then performing a complete analysis using both graphs and SQL queries.
